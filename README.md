I get paid for working on Android apps since 2013. Linux stuff I do in my spare time since 2006.

I sometimes go by Joel Bodega (easier one for non Polish folks)

- Kotlin for Android, Bash for Linux/BSD
- But also Java, C#, Python, C/++
- If you posted your code on reddit, I probably left CR over @github
- I usually open source designs unrelated to software
