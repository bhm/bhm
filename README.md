I get paid for working on Android apps. Linux/BSD/Raspberry Pi stuff I do in my spare time.

I sometimes go by Joel Bodega (easier one for non Polish folks)

- Working on Android since 2013
- Working with Linux since 2006-ish
- Kotlin for Android, Bash for Linux/BSD
- But also Java, C#, Python, C/++
- If you posted your code on reddit, I probably left CR over @github
- I usually open source designs unrelated to software
